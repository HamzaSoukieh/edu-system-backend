# Decisions

## D001 - One Shared Backend For School And University
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Keep one multi-tenant backend that supports both institution types.
- Reason: Avoid parallel systems and duplicated logic.
- Notes: Prefer shared services with institution-type-specific validation where needed.

## D002 - Keep Architecture Simple
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Use `routes -> middleware -> controller -> service -> model`.
- Reason: Clear responsibilities and easier maintenance.
- Notes: Controllers stay thin; services hold business rules.

## D003 - Tenant Scope Is Mandatory
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Scope tenant-owned data by `institutionId` in queries and mutations.
- Reason: Multi-tenant safety.
- Notes: Use `req.tenantId` and `req.membership` from middleware.

## D004 - User / Membership / MemberProfile Split
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision:
  - `User` = auth only
  - `Membership` = institution access + role
  - `MemberProfile` = personal info
- Reason: Keeps identity, tenant access, and personal data separated cleanly.
- Notes: Keep this split stable unless there is a strong migration reason.

## D005 - One Active Semester Per Institution
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Only one semester may be `active` for a given institution.
- Reason: Simplifies current scheduling and active-context rules.
- Notes: Enforced in the semester module and schema/index logic.

## D006 - Subject Stays Shared
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Keep one shared `Subject` model.
- Reason: Course catalog logic should stay reusable across institution types.
- Notes: `creditHours` remains part of Subject academically; university requires it, school can omit it.

## D007 - Section Stays Shared
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Keep one shared `Section` model and service for university now and school later.
- Reason: Section is the semester offering concept in both flows.
- Notes: Avoid separate school/university section systems.

## D008 - Do Not Store departmentId On Section
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: `Section` should not have a direct `departmentId`.
- Reason: Keeps Section reusable for future school support.
- Notes: For university filtering, derive department through `Subject`.

## D009 - Section Read Shapes Split
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision:
  - list response = lightweight summary
  - detail/get-by-id response = fuller shape
- Reason: Lists should stay lighter and easier to consume.
- Notes: `createSection` and `updateSection` still return the fuller detail response.

## D010 - Room Conflict Validation Lives In Service Logic
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Prevent room conflicts in `Section` service logic, not by DB unique index.
- Reason: Overlap logic depends on schedule arrays and time ranges.
- Notes: Compare same institution + same semester + same room + same day + overlapping time, only for room-reserving statuses like `draft` and `active`.

## D011 - Minimal Safe Change Preference
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Prefer incremental changes over broad redesigns.
- Reason: Reduces regression risk and keeps momentum.
- Notes: When future school support needs a wider refactor, document it first.

## D012 - Responsibilities Are Scoped, Not Default Onboarding
- Status: Confirmed
- Decision: Base access comes from role; scoped delegated access belongs in `ResponsibilityAssignment`.
- Reason: Keeps onboarding simpler and permissions more explicit.
- Notes: Responsibility routes/workflows are still mostly pending.
